# React To-Do App  

This project is a simple **To-Do List Application** built using React. It reflects my learning journey as I explore the fundamentals of React and modern CSS styling with TailwindCSS.  

## Features  
- Add new tasks to the list.  
- Delete tasks from the list.  
- Move tasks up or down in the list.  

## Concepts Used  
In this project, I implemented the following React concepts:  
1. **React Functional Components**: The entire app is built using functional components.  
2. **useState Hook**: Used to manage the state of tasks and the input field.  
3. **Event Handling**: Handled user interactions like adding, deleting, and reordering tasks.  
4. **Dynamic Rendering**: Rendered the task list dynamically based on the state.  
5. **Props and Key**: Used `key` props to uniquely identify list items.  

## What I Learned  
1. How to use the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.  
2. How to handle user input and update the state dynamically.  
3. How to manipulate arrays in React to add, delete, and reorder items.  
4. How to use TailwindCSS for styling and creating responsive, modern UI components.  
5. How to structure a React project and write clean, reusable code.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.  
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add local storage to persist tasks.  
- Add task editing functionality.  
- Improve the UI with animations and transitions.  

This project has been a great learning experience, and I look forward to building more complex applications as I continue my React journey!
